🚀 How It Works

The Simple Calculator allows the user to:

Enter two numerical values

Choose the desired arithmetic operation

The program processes the input

The final result is displayed instantly

Most implementations use:

Conditional statements (if-else)

Functions for each operation

Loops for repeated calculations (optional)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python / Java / C / C++ / JavaScript (depending on your program)

IDE (optional): VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse, etc.

No external libraries required

📥 Installation & Setup

Download or clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git


Open the project folder:

cd simple-calculator


Run the program (example for Python):

python calculator.py

🧩 Example Usage
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): *
Result: 50

💡 Use Cases

Basic mathematical calculations

Learning arithmetic operations in programming

Ideal for students and beginners

Can be extended into a scientific calculator

📈 Future Improvements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI)

Support for multiple continuous operations

Include advanced operations (square root, power, percentage)

Create a web or mobile version
